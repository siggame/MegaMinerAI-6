Welcome to Modular!

You control an army of von Neumann machines, a group of self-replicating bots with which you will seek out and destroy the Enemy.

These bots can temporarily combine together to form bigger bots, with each smaller bot making up a component of the bigger bot and moving together as one. Combined bots take on the attributes of their component bots, so different combinations of bots result in different "flavors" of bigger bots. These combined bots can combine with other combined bots of the same size to create bigger bots, and those bots can combine with other bots of the same size to create even BIGGER bots, and so on to infinity (or at least the size of the map.)

There are six types of bots, A through F. All can be mixed in any combination to form a larger bot.
Action -- These bots, when combined, give the combined bot a bonus to the number of actions it can perform in a turn.
Build -- These bots are able to build other bots of the same size or smaller, and can heal other bots.
Cannon -- These bots have a ranged attack.
Damage -- These bots do more damage on attack than default.
Engine -- These bots can move farther per turn.
Force Field -- These bots have more health than default.

Move: Bots can move only in the cardinal directions "udlr" (Up, Down, Left, Right). The default maximum move rate is one unit per turn, though bots with engines can move faster. 

Map dimensions and origin: The map is 20 units tall by 40 units wide. Note that (0,0) is the top-left space the map, and thus (0,19) is the bottom-left space, (39, 0) is the top-right space, and (39, 19) is the bottom-right space. Accessor functions for this are 

Talk: Bots can talk. The talk function takes in a string. Talking causes the string to show up in the visualizer. This can be useful for debug statements.
