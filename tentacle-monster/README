This is divided into roughly three parts:

Launcher:
Runs commands on a list of servers over ssh.

Tentacle:
A daemon run on the servers.

Monster:
A program that connects to all the tentacles and makes them do stuff.


The server list should contain every public Linux machine on campus.



To use:

Put tentacle on your student drive, and put a tentacle.sh in your home directory that will run it.
Note: Tentacle uses RPyC, which is not pre-installed you can grab it from http://rpyc.wikidot.com/

Run launcher.py
This should give some fairly verbose output to tell you which servers it could and couldn't connect to.

Run monster.py
This should list all the servers, and how much free RAM each has!

Run launcher.py "killall python"
This is important, because it will shut down tentacle. Otherwise, everyone will be unable to launch new tentacles. and they will be angry!
