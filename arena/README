Programs:

update/update.py: (port 18862)
responsible for sending out compressed binaries of clients and the server (and all the versions thereof)

db.py: (port 18863)
responsible for all database i/o

tentacle/tentacle.py: (port 18861)
daemon that runs on campus linux machines, runs games it's told to do so, gets files from the update server, sends results to the db server

monster.py: (port 18864)
1) connects to all campus machines, starts tentacles on them
2) generates and maintains a queue of games to run, using the most recent versions available (via the db)
3) as they become available, runs the games in the queue on a tentacle
4) runs tournaments

USAGE:

To Connect to a service: conn = rpyc.connect("Location",port#)
To use an exposed function: result = conn.root.func(arg0,arg1,...)
To call a function asyncronously:
  a = rpyc.async(conn.root.func)
  result = a(arg0,arg1,...)
  
  result.ready is False until the result has returned
  result.value is the value (when returned)
  result.error is True if an error was returned

Be certain to stop all the tentacles, otherwise they will sit there and eat up the port

launcher works (hasn't changed) and will (probably) be rewritten after everythign else works

make a folder called logs, because the program assumes one is in /arena.  otherwise it'll probably yell at you.
