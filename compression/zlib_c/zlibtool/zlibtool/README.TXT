It's difficult to properly document a set of source code when
so much of it is generated by VC++.  The first important thing
to note about this OCX is the set of properties, events, and
methods found in the ODL file:

        BSTR InputFile          //Property
        BSTR OutputFile         //Property
        int Level               //Property
        BSTR Status             //Property
        Compress()              //Method
        Decompress()            //Method
        Abort()                 //Method
        Progress()              //Event

The second important thing to note about the OCX is that it is
implemented based on a Win32 progress bar.  The progress bar should
mimic the output of the Progress() function.

If you can handle these two things, you should be able to figure out
how the OCX works.

Important files
---------------

The files where stuff you are interested in are:

        ZlibToolCtl.cpp : The place where most of the C++ code that
                          implements the engine is found.  This is
                          the implementation file for class CZlibToolCtrl,
                          which has a member m_Engine which is an
                          instance of the wrapper class.

        ZlibToolCtl.h   : The file where CZlibToolCtrl is declared.

To build the OCX project, just open the MAK file using the VC++ 4.x
Open Workspace function, and away you go.
