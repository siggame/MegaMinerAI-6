This directory contains most of the source code for Zlib 1.0.
A few files that aren't used in this project have been left out,
as have the make files and documentation.  You can download those
from the Zlib sites mentioned in the article.

The options used to compile the files will vary depending on your
compiler.  The various projects used here have some documentation
on use with Borland and Microsoft.  See the make files included with
Zlib for information on your compiler.
