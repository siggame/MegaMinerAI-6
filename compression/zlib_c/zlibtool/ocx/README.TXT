This directory contains the OCX, support DLLs, and the registration
program.  Programs like Delphi and VB can register the DLL on their own,
but if you want to, you can register it from the command line like this:
REGSVR32 ZLIBTOOL.OCX.  If you don't have up to date versions of the
DLLs, you can copy them to your WIN95\SYSTEM directory.
